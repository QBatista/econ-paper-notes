## Miller (1988)

- The topic of this paper is the Modigliani-Miller proposition.
- The paper revisits the original Modigliani and Miller (1958) paper after 30 years. 
- By the time, the irrelevance of the capital structure has become accepted as an implication of equilibrium in perfect capital markets.
- The paper discusses three lines of objections made with regards to this proposition relating to (i) dividends, (ii) debt defaults, and (iii) taxes.
- Originally, the paper opted for a so-called Fisherian (as opposed to Marshallian) representation of the firm, that is, viewing the firm as an abstract engine transforming current consumable resources into future consumable resources payable to the owners of the securities.
- One issue with the original proof is the question of how real world market equilibrators could gain access to a firm's operating cash flows. In particular, investors get access to the dividends that firms declare, not the cash flows themselves.
- In response to this criticism, Modigliani and Miller stated a so-called dividend invariance policy, that is, that the value of a firm doesn't depend on its policy. 
- Empirically, we observe that prices tend to jump around announcements of changes in dividend policy. These observations can be seen as evidence of the failure of the critical assumption that capital market participants and managers have the same information.
- Another issue with the original proof is that it blurrs the line between the corporation and other forms of business organizations. While corporations have limited liability, individuals do not. Hence, individuals cannot really hope to duplicate corporate structures on their own. One way to get around this issue is that corporations themselves may be the ones acting as arbitrageurs.
- Finally, taxation is also a first-order issue. In particular, while interest on indebtness can be deducted from gross income, no such allowance has been made for costs of equity capital. 
- One way to view the MM propositions in light of taxation is to view the government as a shareholder. In that case, the value of the firm is not independent of the debt to equity division.
