## Tirole (2005): Chapter 3

- The topic of this chapter is outside financing capacity and the puzzle of credit rationing: why are lenders not willing to raise interest rates if the demand for loans exceeds their supply at the prevailing rate?
- Some economists view credit rationing as an equilibrium phenomenon. This line of reasoning relies on adverse selection and moral hazard arguments. 
- The starting point is the following observation: a higher interest rate has no effect on the borrower in the event of bankruptcy as long as the borrower is protected by limited liability.
- The moral hazard explanation is that the reduced stake demotivates the borrower. The adverse selection explanation is that when lenders cannot directly tell good and bad borrowers apart, higher interest rates attract lower quality borrowers.

### A simple model of credit rationing

An entrepreneur has a project that requires a fixed investment $I$. 

The entrepreneur also has assets $A < I$. It can either be invested in the project or used for consumption.

To implement the project, the entrepreneur must borrow $I-A$ from lenders.

If undertaken, the project either yields verifiable income $R>0$ or nothing.

The probability of success is denoted $p$. 

The project is subject to moral hazard. If the entrepreneur exerts effort, the probability of success is $p=p_{H}$. When shirking, the probability is $p=p_{L}$.

Borrowers and lenders are assumed to be risk-neutral.

The borrower is protected by limited liability, implying that her income cannot be negative.

Lenders behave competitively and therefore do not earn profits in equilibrium.

In case of success, the two parties share the profit $R$. $R_b$ goes to the borrower and $R_l$ to the lenders. This agreeement may be interpreted either as risky debt or as equity.

The zero-profit constraint for the lenders can be written as 

$$p_H R_l = I - A$$

assuming that the loan agreement induces the borrower to behave.

The rate of interest $\iota$ is given by  

$$R_l = \left(1+\iota\right)\left(I-A\right)$$

Unless $p_H=1$, the nominal rate of interest $\iota$ reflects a default premium.

We assume that the project is viable only in the absence of moral hazard, that is, $p_{H}R-I>0$ and $p_{L}R-I+B<0$.

By misbehaving, the borrower can receive private benefit $B$. The borrower will therefore behave if the following incentive compatibility constraint is satisfied:

$$R_b \geq p_L R_b + B$$

A participation constraint for the lender is 

$$p_H \left(R-\frac{B}{\Delta p}\right) \geq I - A$$

If $A$ is too small, this condition may not be satisfied. This corresponds to the situation where the borrower is demotivated. In this situation, there is credit rationing. Informally, this captures the idea that "one only lends to the rich".

Another way that this condition may be violated is if $p_H \frac{B}{\Delta p}$ is too high. This term represents agency cost, that is, the manager's ability to squander investor money.  

This model can be used to think about various issues such as overborrowing, reputational capital, information usage, or the sensitivity of investment to cash flow. 

Debt overhang describes the situation in which a borrower is debt-ridden and unable to raise funds for an otherwise profitable project.

One approach is to re-interpret this situation as a credit rationining problem. Previous investors' collateral claim reduces the net worth below the threshold level.

Another approach stresses the need for renegotiating past liabilities.
