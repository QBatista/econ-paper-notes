## Modigliani and Miller (1958)

- The topic of this paper is the cost of capital. In particular, it provides the foundations of a theory of the valuation of firms and shares in a world of uncertainty. 
- If one assumes that phyiscal assets could be regarded as yielding known, sure streams, it is possible to conclude that the cost of capital to the owners is simply the rate of interest on bonds. This can be shown from either of two criteria under rational decision-making: (i) the maximization of profits or (ii) the maximization of market value.
- In the first case, a physical asset is worth acquiring if it will increase the net profit of the owners. In turn, net profit increases if the expected rate of return of the asset exceeds the rate of interest. 
- The logic of the second case is similar, except that it pertains to the value of the owners' equity.
- To some extent, this analysis can allow for uncertainty by considering certainty equivalent yield. While this is a convenient approximation, it may not be an adequate one.
- Once risk is introduced, the level of profits becomes a random variable. Profit maximization is no longer well defined in the sense that decisions may raise expected profits but also affect other features of the distribution. To address this problem, one line of attack is to introduce a subjective utility function that weighs the different features of the distribution. Unfortunately, this approach has drawbacks for normative and analytical purposes. 
- Fortunately, the drawbacks can be bypassed by focusing on the market value approach.
- The main proposition of the paper asserts the market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure. 
- There are five key assumptions underlying this result: (i) there are no transaction costs, (ii) capital markets are competitive, (iii) there are no bankruptcy costs, (iv) there are no taxes, and (v) there is no cost asymmetry.
- The proof uses an arbitrage argument. At a high level, if the proposition did not hold, investors could buy an income stream at a low price and sell it at a high price.
- Further derivation from the previous proposition can be used to show that the expected rate of return on a stock is a linear function of leverage.
- The paper then considers three extensions: (i) allowing for a corporate profit tax, (ii) recognizing the existence of a multiplicity of bonds and interest rates, and (iii) acknowledging the presence of market imperfections.
