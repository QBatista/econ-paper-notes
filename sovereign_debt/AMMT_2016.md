- The topic of this paper is the enveloppe condition method (ECM).
- The goal is to offer a tractable alternative to value function iteration.
- The algorithm features two novel features. First, the algorithm constructs policy functions using enveloppe conditions. Second, the algorithm solves for derivatives of the value function.
- The resulting algorithm can solve models accurately with at least up to 20 state variables.
- When solving enveloppe conditions, ECM only requires direct computation, and therefore, does not require using potentially expensive numerical solvers.
- Enveloppe conditions feature the derivative of the value function? As such, it is natural to expect that the accuracy of our solution will depend on the quality of the approximation of the derivative of the value function. In principle, this could be problematic because solving accurately for the value function does not necessarily lead to an accurate solution of the derivative 
- Unfortunately, while ECM has the same fixed point as the regular Bellman operator, it does not possess the contraction mapping property. The algorithm still appears to be useful in practice.
