## Arellano (2008)

- The topic of this paper is default risk and its interaction with output and foreign debt.

- The paper develops a small open economy model to study this topic. In particular, it extends the approach developed by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981). 

- Emerging markets tend to have volatile business cycles and experience economic crises more frequently than developed economies.

- One potential factor explaining this fact is that emerging economies face highly countercyclical interest rates. This suggests that it is important to study default risk, interest rates and aggregate fluctuations jointly. 

- The paper develops a stochastic general equilibrium model with endogenous default risk. The borrower is a benevolent government of a small open economy which trades bonds with foreign creditors. Bond contracts reflect default probabilities that are endogenous to the borrower's incentives to default. This implies that the equilibrium interest rate is linked to default. Default entails temporary exclusion from international financial markets. 

- Defaults happen along the equilibrium because markets are incomplete. In turn, risk neutral competitive lenders are willing to offer debt contracts that in some states will result in default by charging a higher premium on the loans. 

- Market incompleteness plays a critical role in this model by reversing the usual relationship between default and output. Here, default incentives are higher in bad times. After a prolonged recession, debt holdings can grow so much that the economy experiences net capital outflows. These outflows are more costly for a risk averse borrower in times of low shocks, making default more attractive in recessions. 

- The model is calibrated to Argentina to study the 2001 default episode. It can account for (i) the volatility of interest rates, (ii) the negative correlations of output and consumption with interest rates, (iii) the negative correlation between the trade balance and output, (iv) the positive correlation between the trade balance and interest rates, and (v) the higher volatility of consumption relative to output. The main feature that facilitates these results is the persistence of shocks. The main anomaly is the low average spread it generates.
