## Borri and Verdelhan (2012)

- The topic of this paper is sovereign risk premia. 

- Many studies of sovereign yields assume that investors are risk-neutral. This paper challenges this assumption and explores the importance of risk aversion. 

- Intuitively, the correlation between macroeconomic conditions in emerging countries and in the US impinges on the compensation that US investors expect from sovereign bonds.

- Emprically, the higher the correlation between past foreign bond and US market returns, the higher the average sovereign excess return. 

- To uncover the implications of these findings in terms of optimal borrowing and default, the authors develop a model with endogenous default and time-varying risk premia. 

- To establish the main empirical fact, the authors construct portfolios of emerging market bonds based on their beta (i.e. estimate of the regression coefficient of the foreign bond excess return on the US market excess return) and an estimate of the default probability. 

- To formally test that a common risk factor (in this case log total return on the U.S. stock or corporate bond index) can explain excess returns on sovereign bonds, the authors build on the arbitrage pricing theory of Ross (1976). In particular, they test the Euler equation assuming that the stochastic discount factor can be expressed as a log-linear function of risk factors.

- To study the macroeconomic implications of their findings (on the amount of debt and decision to default), the authors develop a model with endogenous default and time-varying risk. They build on the existing literature, and the main innovation is that lenders are assumed to be risk averse instead of risk-neutral. Besides, emerging countries' business cycles differ in their correlations to the US business cycle.
